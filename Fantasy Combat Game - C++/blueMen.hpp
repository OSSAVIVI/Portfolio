 ** Description:  This is the header file for the BlueMen child class.
 ** Characterstics: They are small, 6 inch tall, but fast and tough. They are hard to
 ** hit so they can take some damage. They can also do a LOT of damage when they crawl
 ** inside enemiesâ€™ armor or clothing.
 ** Special Abilities: Mob: Blue Men are actually a swarm of small individuals. For
 ** every 4 points of damage, they lose one defense die. For example, if they have a
 ** strength of 8, they would have 2d6 for defense.
