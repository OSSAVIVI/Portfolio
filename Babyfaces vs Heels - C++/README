HOW TO RUN AND COMPILE PROGRAM (for TAs):
	 STEP 1: Place unzipped file's contents into the desired directory on the School's Flip server.
			a. Place the desired test-files in the same directory as the unzipped files' contents
			b. Alternatively, use one of the four included file names below
				  i. wwrestler0.txt
				 ii. wwrestler1.txt
				iii. wwrestler2.txt
				 iv. wwrestler3.txt
 	 STEP 2: From the directory, type the "make" command and then hit ENTER to compile the program.
	 STEP 3: From the same directory, type "output" and then hit ENTER to run the program.
	 STEP 4: After being greeted, enter 1 to START the program or 2 to EXIT the program.
	 STEP 5: From here the user has three options:
	 	 1. Babyfaces vs Heels! (wrestling program) 
	 	 2. Take a break from it all... //Note: this was just put in for fun, although please take a break if needed :)
	 	 3. QUIT (back to START/EXIT).
	 STEP 6: After each selection, the user will continue to be prompted to select an option 1 - 3 until 3 is selected.
	 STEP 7: Have a wonderful day and thank you for grading!
