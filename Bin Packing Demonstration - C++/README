HOW TO RUN AND COMPILE PROGRAM (for TAs):
	 STEP 1: Place unzipped file's contents into the desired directory on the School's Flip server.
			a. Replace the bin.txt file with the desired bin.txt file in the same directory as the unzipped files
			b. Alternatively, paste desired data into the existing act.txt file
			c. Or leave bin.txt alone
 	 STEP 2: From the directory, type the "make" command and then hit ENTER to compile the program.
	 STEP 3: From the same directory, type "output" and then hit ENTER to run the program.
	 STEP 4: After being greeted, enter 1 to START the program or 2 to EXIT the program.
	 STEP 5: From here the user has three options:
	 	 1. Binpacking Approximation Algorithm. 
	 	 2. Take a break from it all... //Note: this was just put in for fun, although please take a break if needed :)
	 	 3. QUIT (back to START/EXIT).
	 STEP 6: After each selection, the user will continue to be prompted to select an option 1 - 3 until 3 is selected.
	 STEP 7: Have a wonderful day and thank you for a great quarter!
