 ** Program name: mainProject1.cpp file for [Week 1, Project 1] CS_162_400_S2019
 ** Author: Ryan Wells Farran
 ** Date: 04/14/2019 | Sunday, April 14th 2019
 ** Description: This program uses langtonAnt.hpp/.cpp, langtonBoard.hpp/.cpp, menu.hpp/.cpp,
 ** and inputVal.hpp/.cpp and simulates the Langton's Ant procedure using the console input/output.
 ** Basically, the user will create a grid (Langton's Board) of a certain size they choose,
 ** and then an "ant" (*) will go around and if it hits a white square it will turn right and go forward,
 ** and alternatively if it hits a black square it will turn left and then go forward, but in each scenario,
 ** before moving forward the Langton Ant will "swap" the color of the square it is about to exit.
 ** This may sound boring, but play around with the software and notice how the larger the screen
 ** and number of iterations set by the suer, the more interesting the final output becomes.
 ** Notice too how when the ant reaches the edge of the screen it "wraps around" to the otherside,
 ** and in fact, the pattern even continues. This is showed in a bit more detail in the refletion piece of
 ** this assignment. Earlier I was having trouble with deleting my memory; I was calling the destructor
 ** using board.~LangtonBoard(); but it was throwing an error when I tried to restart my program.
 ** I simply commented out the line and so now I beleive that my program is working properly and
 ** automatically calling my destructor function becuase I was able to run very large simulations back to back
 ** without any complaints from the compiler in XCode and Flip. All in all, this was by far the most
 ** exciting thing I have ever made so far in programming! I found watching the simulations
 ** run to be very beautiful! Thanks to who ever is reading this and have a great day!
